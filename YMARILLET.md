Easy install / test
-------------------
I created a docker env + a self documented Makefile base in order to make life easier to run the project in a dev environment.

This Makefile uses a little "hack" in order to use arguments on make targets.

Makefile is a deliberate choice here, main reason to use it over another system alike is because it's more portable.
